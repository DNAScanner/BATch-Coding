# DNA's Batch projects
Here's a little overview with the most up-to-date releases and betas of my projects

## Disclaimer
There's no guarantee that those projects all work completely fine, but most of them do work (at least for me) without any issues

## Overview
- [x] [Config Files](https://github.com/DNAScanner/BATch-Coding/tree/main/ConfigFiles) - Basic Example for reading and saving config files
- [x] [Selection Menu](https://github.com/DNAScanner/BATch-Coding/tree/main/SelectionMenu) - Basic Example for a Menu, in which you can cycle through the options
- [x] [Selection Menu v2](https://github.com/DNAScanner/BATch-Coding/tree/main/SelectionMenu%20v2) - More advanced and more customizable version of the original one
- [x] [Color Codes](https://github.com/DNAScanner/BATch-Coding/blob/main/-ColorCodes.cmd) - A list with all available color codes, very useful

## This is just my repository for simple batch __integrations__, if you want to take a look at some _more advanced_ stuff, you may look at the other repositories such as:
- [x] [Snake](https://github.com/NoBugBatchler/Snake) - This is my custom batch (command prompt) script for the original, retro Snake game
- [x] [TicTacToe](https://github.com/NoBugBatchler/TicTacToe) - This is my custom batch (command prompt) script for the original TicTacToe game
